&lt;p>&lt;strong>This is Brews &amp;amp; Brainwaves, a barista-turned-programmerâ€™s guide to coffee shop productivity.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My name is Laurens. I am an electrical engineering master&amp;rsquo;s student at RWTH Aachen University, and I have a passion for software. With a barista history, I have always loved the ambiance of working in a cozy coffee shop instead of the isolation of home, and the discomfort most university study spots. So whenever I can, I take my study or work material on an excursion to a coffee shop in my town or wherever I happen to be at the moment, enjoy some coffee and work productively. I initially decided to document each of these visits for myself for later reference, and thought it might be useful to other remote workers or like minded folks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So feel free to join me on my journey of discovering the perfect coffee spot for a productive work day!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
