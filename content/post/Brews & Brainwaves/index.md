# Welcome!

**This is Brews & Brainwaves, a barista-turned-programmerâ€™s guide to coffee shop productivity.**

My name is Laurens. I am an electrical engineering master's student at RWTH Aachen University, and I have a passion for software. With a barista history, I have always loved the ambiance of working in a cozy coffee shop instead of the isolation of home, and the discomfort most university study spots. So whenever I can, I take my study or work material on an excursion to a coffee shop in my town or wherever I happen to be at the moment, enjoy some coffee and work productively. I initially decided to document each of these visits for myself for later reference, and thought it might be useful to other remote workers or like minded folks. 

So feel free to join me on my journey of discovering the perfect coffee spot for a productive work day!
